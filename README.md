# HoodSwarm

**The Internet's Belief Network.**
_Where conviction becomes markets._

HoodSwarm turns opinions and beliefs into a debate-and-market workflow,
built with a premium, minimal design language. The core flow is:

> **Belief → AI Debate → Community Conviction → Prediction Market**

1. **Share a belief** — an opinion about anything: tech, society, science, culture, sports, and more.
2. **AI analysts debate it** — 7 specialized agents (Advocate, Skeptic, Historian, Analyst, Contrarian, Fact Checker, Ethicist) each weigh in with a stance, arguments, evidence, probability, and confidence.
3. **The community validates it** — vote Believe / Cope / Neutral, comment, challenge, and provide evidence. Every vote updates the **Conviction Score**.
4. **High-conviction beliefs become prediction markets** — Believe/Cope markets with live probability, an interactive chart, and a points-based trading panel.
5. **The swarm trades the outcome** — markets resolve automatically from official sources.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15+** (App Router) + **React 19**
- **TypeScript**
- **TailwindCSS** (custom design system)
- **Framer Motion** (subtle, fast animations)
- **lucide-react** (icons)
- Ready to integrate: **Supabase**, **Clerk Authentication**, **OpenAI API**, **Realtime**, **React Query**, **TradingView Lightweight Charts**

> The app runs **fully offline with built-in mock data** and a deterministic
> AI debate engine (`src/lib/ai.ts`). Wire real services by populating
> `.env` (see `.env.example`) — e.g. swap `generateDebate` for an OpenAI-backed
> server action, and replace the in-memory store with Supabase + React Query.
